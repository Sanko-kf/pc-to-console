# PC to Console

The goal of this project is to transform a Windows PC into a gaming console, exclusively controllable with a gamepad, while providing practical and essential improvements to the user experience. By enhancing the experience of Steam Big Picture, it aims to offer a fluid and easy-to-use environment, while adding often-overlooked features such as customizable sleep mode management, automated addition of non-Steam games to Steam, and the automation of certain system tasks to streamline daily usage.

The project relies on a series of scripts and tools designed to simplify the installation, configuration, and operation of a PC in console mode. Rather than focusing on "out-of-the-box" solutions, it offers a range of customizable features, allowing users to create a unique experience that goes beyond the limitations of existing systems.

> This project provides a set of scripts and tools to enhance the console-like experience on a PC, primarily leveraging Steam Big Picture and other existing applications.

## Features 

This project is a work in progress, with new features being added over time. Currently, the following features are available:

- Custom Steam boot video

- Custom Sleep Mode

In addition, several other features have been manually implemented, such as:

- Disabling manual Windows login

- Automating the installation of necessary software (though this is currently done manually)

These manual implementations will be automated and integrated into future updates. Stay tuned for additional updates and features as the project develops.
## Installation (Coming Soon)

The install.sh script will guide the user through the basic installation process, along with optional modules.
