# PC to Console

> ** Important Note: If you're using an AMD system, consider installing [BazziteOS](https://bazzite.gg/)** for **better smoothness and performance**.

## Description

The goal of this project is to transform a Windows PC into a gaming console, exclusively controllable with a gamepad, while providing practical and essential improvements to the user experience. By enhancing the experience of Steam Big Picture, it aims to offer a fluid and easy-to-use environment, while adding often-overlooked features such as customizable sleep mode management, automated addition of non-Steam games to Steam, and the automation of certain system tasks to streamline daily usage.

The project relies on a series of scripts and tools designed to simplify the installation, configuration, and operation of a PC in console mode. Rather than focusing on "out-of-the-box" solutions, it offers a range of customizable features, allowing users to create a unique experience that goes beyond the limitations of existing systems.
